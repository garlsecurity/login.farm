# Terms of Service

Our Terms of Services are pretty simple to understand. Login.farm is free and 
managed/operated on a voluntary basis by [Giuseppe Paterno'](http://www.gpaterno.com) 
and [GARL Sagl](http://www.garl.ch) as a give-back to the OpenSource community.

We will do our best to keep login.farm up&running, available and secure.
It shares the same multi-datacenter infrastructure of other GARL services and
the main site located deep under the Swiss Alps, in a former military bunker.
It is backed up using the same procedures of other services.

That said, login.farm is provided as a service with NO GUARANTEES, NO WARRANTIES, 
NO SUPPORT. ***The use of login.farm is only under your responsibility***. 
In no way Giuseppe Paterno', GARL or other project members are liable for 
the operation, loss of data/information, financial losses, etc...

If you are seeking for a supported, enterprise-grade service backed by
an insurance policy for any loss, please consider [SecurePass](http://www.secure-pass.net).
